Topology optimization uses a variable permeability approach to manipulate flow geometries. Such a method has been employed in the current work to modify 
the geometric configuration of internal cooling ducts by manipulating the distribution of material blockage. A modified version of the OpenFOAM solver 
AdjointShapeOptimizationFOAM has been used to optimize the flow-path of  rectangular ducts, with increase in heat transfer and reduction in pressure drop 
as the objective functions.

The flow of the process can be seen as:
